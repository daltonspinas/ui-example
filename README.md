# UI Showcase
* This is a simple React app to demonstrate my ability to create a frontend/UI given a static mockup (adapted from a take home assessment)
* You can read the `PROJECT_GUIDELINES` and `business_overview` images which served as the basis for this project in the root directory
* This project was built using create-react-app for the basic scaffolding and react-tabs for the header navigation component

## Viewing the app 
* You can view the live app at ui-showcase.daltonspinas.com
* Alternatively you can clone the repo and cd into the root directory, then `npm install` and `npm start`
